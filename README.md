# ML_ElectricalPowerOutputPrediction

## Regression Analysis to Predict Electrical Power Output
Using statistical analysis implemented in python inorder to predict the electrical power output of a power plant. The power plant is a combined cycle power plant that consists of 2 gas turbines and 1 steam turbine. The 4 input parameters we need to observe for our predictions are:
- Atmospheric pressure (AT)
- Relative Humidity (RH)
- Vacuum (V)
- Exhaust Steam Pressure (ESP)
